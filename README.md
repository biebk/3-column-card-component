## My process
In order to center the card component I have used css flex in the body.Similarly I have also used flexbox property on container to align column nicely next to each other. CSS flex can be very handy when it comes to put any items vertically and horizantally center. Except from that, I have used core css knowledge to perfectly build the card component.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this challenge I have applied my fundamentals CSS knowledge to built the layout of 3 column card component. For this I have used css flexbox many times.
